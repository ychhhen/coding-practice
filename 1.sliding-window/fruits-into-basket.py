# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
# you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
# The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
# You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. 
# You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, 
# i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

# Example:
# Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']

'''
ideas:
= find the longest subarray with 2 distinct element

# for loop to pick up fruit
# dict to check types of fruit <=2
# while over 2 fruit types, drop the fruit picked up at the beginning 
# len+1
